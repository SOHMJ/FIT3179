            <p>This global COVID-19 choropleth map provides insights into the pandemic's impact across countries. It
                challenges assumptions about case distribution, emphasizing the importance of considering both
                population size and land area. Densely populated countries might show high cases due to concentration,
                while vast, sparsely populated areas may report fewer cases. The map offers a nuanced view of COVID-19's
                global spread.</p>

            <p>Despite variations in tourism levels, many countries enforced full lockdowns starting from February 24,
                2020,
                during the second wave of the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>

            <h2 class="half-title">COVID-19 Fatality by Demographics</h2>
            <div id="age"></div>
            <p>The line chart presented here illustrates the average fatality rate corresponding to different mean age
                categories.
                <br><br>
                When the mean age of COVID-19 patients in a country is lower, the fatality rate tends to be
                higher. Surprisingly, countries with a higher mean age among COVID-19 patients tend to have a lower
                fatality rate.
                <br><br>
                It's worth noting that babies and the elderly are not representative of the mean age for
                COVID-19 patients in all countries.

            <div id="pollution"></div>
            <p>The impact of outdoor pollution remains relatively consistent regardless of population size. In contrast,
                indoor pollution death rates exhibit a significant increase in areas with larger populations.</p>
