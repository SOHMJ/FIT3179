        <h2>Understanding the Choropleth Map: COVID-19 Cases by Country</h2>
        <div class="graph">
            <div id="map">
            </div class="top-left-text">
            <p>Our choropleth map visualizes COVID-19 cases in different countries, offering insights into the
                pandemic's global impact. While it might be intuitive to assume that countries with larger
                populations would have more cases, the reality is more nuanced.
                <br><br>
                When analyzing the data, it's crucial to consider not only population size but also the area of each
                country. Some densely populated countries might have a high number of cases due to the concentration
                of people, even if the country's total land area is relatively small.
                <br><br>
                Conversely, countries with vast land areas and sparse populations might report fewer cases despite
                their large size. The map allows us to visualize this complex relationship, offering a more accurate
                perspective on the distribution of COVID-19 cases worldwide.

            </div class="top-left-text">
            <p>Despite variations in tourism levels, many countries enforced full lockdowns starting from February 24,
                2020,
                during the second wave of the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>

            <h2>COVID-19 Fatality by Demographics</h2>
            <div id="age"></div>
            <p>The line chart presented here illustrates the average fatality rate corresponding to different mean age
                categories. 
                <br><br>
                When the mean age of COVID-19 patients in a country is lower, the fatality rate tends to be
                higher. Surprisingly, countries with a higher mean age among COVID-19 patients tend to have a lower
                fatality rate. 
                <br><br>
                It's worth noting that babies and the elderly are not representative of the mean age for
                COVID-19 patients in all countries.</p>
