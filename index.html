            </div class="top-left-text">
            <p>The choropleth map illustrates COVID-19 cases by country. Contrary to expectations, larger population
                sizes don't always correlate with higher case numbers.
                <br><br>
                For instance, the United States, with a smaller
                population compared to China and India, exhibits the highest case count. This highlights the complex
                factors influencing the pandemic's spread.

            <div id="tourism">
            </div class="top-left-text">
            <p>Despite variations in tourism levels, many countries enforced full lockdowns starting from February 24,
                2020,during the second wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. 
                <br><br>
                Countries with lower levels of tourism tend to
                experience a delayed onset of COVID-19 transmission. This pattern suggests that reduced international
                travel might contribute to a slower spread of the virus within these regions.</p>

            <h2 class="half-title">COVID-19 Fatality by Demographics</h2>
            <div id="age"></div>
            <p>The line chart presented here illustrates the average fatality rate corresponding to different mean age
                categories.
                <br><br>
                When the mean age of COVID-19 patients in a country is lower, the fatality rate tends to be
                higher. Surprisingly, countries with a higher mean age among COVID-19 patients tend to have a lower
                fatality rate.
                <br><br>
                It's worth noting that babies and the elderly are not representative of the mean age for
                COVID-19 patients in all countries.

            <div id="pollution"></div>
            <p>The impact of outdoor pollution remains relatively consistent regardless of population size. In contrast,
                indoor pollution death rates exhibit a significant increase in areas with larger populations.</p>
